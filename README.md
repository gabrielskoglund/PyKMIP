# PyKMIP

This repository contains a fork of the [PyKMIP](https://github.com/OpenKMIP/PyKMIP)
project, intended to be used as part of my [experiments](https://github.com/gabrielskoglund/kmip-vs-pkcs1)
comparing and evaluating KMIP and PKCS#11. It contains patches that either fixes issues with the
upstream version or adds new functionality, mainly related to the `sign` operation.
It is not suitable for general use.
